'''Autocrypt''' is a [[Standard|standardized]] guideline for [[Email|e-mail]] clients, enabling end-to-end -encryption in a user-friendly way. Version 1.0 of the [https://autocrypt.org/level1.html Autocrypt specification] was released in December of 2017. It builds on and is compatible to [[OpenPGP]], but most importantly automates the exchange of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic keys]] between users.

== Method ==

Autocrypt-capable e-mail clients transparently negotiate encryption capabilities and exchange keys between users alongside sending regular e-mails. This is done by including the key material in the metadata of each e-mail, which allows encrypting any message to a contact who has previously sent the user e-mail. Publishing keys onto the public [[Key server (cryptographic)|key servers]] is not necessary, and no support is required from [[Mailbox provider|e-mail providers]]. 

When a message is encrypted to a group of receivers, keys are also automatically exchanged between all receivers in this group. This ensures that a reply to an encrypted message can be encrypted without any further complications or work by the user.

== Security Model ==

Autocrypt is guided by the idea of opportunistic security from RFC 7435. Encryption of messages between Autocrypt-capable clients can be enabled without further need of user interaction. In contrast to traditional OpenPGP applications, manual verification of keys is not considered a requirement before use. The same principle is used in modern messengers like [[WhatsApp]] and [[Signal (software)|Signal]], which achieve usable end-to-end encryption in a similar way, effectively preventing [[surveillance]] of the content of encrypted messages by a [[Passive attack|passive attacker]]. [[Man-in-the-middle attack|Active attacks]] are impeded{{cn}}, but can't be technically prevented without user interaction.

Autocrypt does not try to encrypt at all possible opportunities.  Instead, it tries to maximize the possible opportunities for encryption.  To achieve this goal, Autocrypt emphasizes simplicity of setup, ease of use, and minimization of unintentionally unreadable messages (which can cause people to abandon encrypted mail altogether).

Manual verification of the peer's cryptographic identity, for example by comparison of [[Fingerprint (cryptography)|fingerprints]], is not part of version 1.0 of Autocrypt, but is planned for future work. While Autocrypt currently lacks this specification, most underlying OpenPGP implementations (like [[GNU Privacy Guard|GnuPG]]) already support some type of manual verification that implementers can experiment with.

== Technical Details ==

Autocrypt uses the established OpenPGP specification as its underlying data format. Messages are encrypted using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys, with a recommended RSA key length of 3072 bits. These mechanisms are chosen for maximum compatibility with existing OpenPGP implementations. There are [https://autocrypt.org/next-steps.html#rsa3072-to-curve-25519|plans] for moving to smaller [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|Elliptic-curve]] keys when support is more widely available.

==  Support ==
Autocrypt is supported in the [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] extension [[Enigmail]] since version 2.0<ref>{{cite web|title=Enigmail - 2018-03-25 Enigmail v2.0 released|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/home/news/63-2018-03-25-enigmail-v2-0-released|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-04-24|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Patrick Brunschwig|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>, the Delta Chat messenger from Version 0.9.2<ref>{{cite web|title=Delta Chat v0.9.2 feat.

The German e-mail provider [[Posteo]] also supports Autocrypt, by additionally cryptographically signing outbound Autocrypt metadata via [[DomainKeys|DKIM]]<ref>{{cite web|title=posteo.de: Vereinfachte E-Mail-Verschlüsselung mit Autocrypt- und OpenPGP-Header|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://posteo.de/blog/neu-vereinfachte-e-mail-verschl%C3%BCsselung-mit-autocrypt-und-openpgp-header|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-04-24|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}</ref>.
