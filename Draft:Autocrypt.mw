'''Autocrypt''' is a [[Standard|standardized]] guideline for [[Email]] clients, that enables encryption in a user-friendly way. The [https://autocrypt.org/level1.html specification] was released in version 1.0 in December 2017. It builds on and is compatible to [[OpenPGP]], but most importantly automates the exchange of [[Key (cryptography)|cryptographic key]] between users.

== Method ==

Email clients capable of Autocrypt transparently negotiate encryption capabilities and exchange keys between users alongside regular Emails. To this end, the key material is included in the metadata of each Email, allowing encryption of messages to any contact an Email was received from. Publishing keys on the public [[Key server (cryptographic)|key servers]] is not necessary, and no support is required from [[Mailbox provider|e-mail providers]]. 

When messages are encrypted to a group of receivers, keys are also automatically exchanged between all receivers in this group. This ensures that replies to encrypted messages can always be encrypted with no further complications. 

== Security Model ==

Autocrypt uses the established OpenPGP specification as its underlying data format. Messages are encrypted using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys, with a recommended key length of 3072 bits. Those mechanisms are chosen for maximum compatibility with existing OpenPGP-implementations. There are plans for moving to smaller [[Elliptic-curve cryptography|Elliptic-curve]] keys when support is more widely available.

The key management model adheres to the idea of opportunistic security from RFC 7435. Encryption of messages between Autocrypt-capable clients can be enabled without further need of user interaction. In contrast to traditional OpenPGP applications, manual verification of keys is not considered a requirement before use. The same principle is used in modern messengers like [[WhatsApp]] and [[Signal (software)|Signal]], which achieve usable end-to-end encryption in a similar way, effectively preventing [[surveillance]] of the content of encrypted messages. [[Man-in-the-middle attack|Active attacks]] are impeded, but can't be technically prevented without user interaction.

A manual verification of keys, for example by comparison of cryptographic [[Fingerprint (cryptography)|fingerprints]], is currently only a planned feature of Autocrypt. Despite this missing specification, most underlying OpenPGP implementations (like [[GNU Privacy Guard|GnuPG]]) already have support for some type of manual verification in practice.

==  Support ==
Autocrypt is supported in the [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] extension [[Enigmail]] since version 2.0<ref>{{Internetquelle|autor=Patrick Brunschwig|url=https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/home/news/63-2018-03-25-enigmail-v2-0-released|titel=Enigmail - 2018-03-25 Enigmail v2.0 released|zugriff=2018-04-24|sprache=en-gb}}</ref>, the Delta Chat messenger from Version 0.9.2<ref>{{Internetquelle|url=https://delta.chat/en/2017-06-28-delta-chat-0-9-2|titel=Delta Chat v0.9.2 feat.

The German Email-Provider [[Posteo]] also supports Autocrypt, by additionally authenticating Autocrypt metadata via [[DomainKeys|DKIM]]<ref>{{Internetquelle|url=https://posteo.de/blog/neu-vereinfachte-e-mail-verschl%C3%BCsselung-mit-autocrypt-und-openpgp-header|titel=posteo.de: Vereinfachte E-Mail-Verschlüsselung mit Autocrypt- und OpenPGP-Header|zugriff=2018-04-24|sprache=de}}</ref>.
